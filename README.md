# Is My Site Cached (.com) Official Page
[ismypagecached.com](http://ismypagecached.com/) detects your "page caching" configuration and current state. The goal: to save you a little bit of time ðŸ˜‡

We try supporting as many page-caching systems as can be detected. Feel free to report issues and add feature requests. 
When reporting an issue, we need:
1. Description of the issue
2. Link for testing
